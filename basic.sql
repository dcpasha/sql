# Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries:
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China');

# BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). 
SELECT name, area FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
